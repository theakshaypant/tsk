# tsk

A terminal calendar client for people who'd rather not deal with calendars.

**tsk** — part "task", part the sound you make when yet another meeting invite lands in your inbox.

---

It's a TUI tool that pulls events from multiple calendar providers (starting with Google) and shows them in your terminal. Because sometimes you just want to see what's eating your day without opening a browser, signing into three accounts, and getting distracted by 47 unread emails.

Works with your primary calendar, shared calendars, subscribed calendars (holidays, team schedules), and all those calendars you forgot you subscribed to.

Still early days. More providers coming eventually. Maybe Outlook. Maybe iCloud. We'll see.
